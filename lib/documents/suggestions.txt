<h1> Library to support knitting machines
	
**Basic abstraction of the library**

As all are agree with this basic abstraction I would like to create library as separate layers
* serial communication : open, configure, read and write to serial port
* machine definitions : machine initialization, load to machine, save from machine
* image handling functions : memory allocation, read image file, setter and getter for image pixels
* file handling functions : read / write access
* common utility functions

**Add dependencies for the library**

There are several dependency libraries which ayab has such as pillow, pyserial, wsgiref, fysom and yapsy with relevant versions. These dependencies should be added to the library. 

**Functions for the library**

* For access hardware directly
       * Identify existing libraries to interface with hardware
       * Use libraries to deal with serial ports
       * Ability to get all the functions via library (for an example functions in ayabControl.py and add more functions to support in more machines)
       * Ability to send QT signals

* Emulate file formats

create functions to emulate file format

* Add Arduino support

**Installation**

Installation should be well documented in step by step. Additionally I suggest to add GUI based installation with usability improvements with standard installation procedures. 

* Installation on Linux (32bit, 64bit)
       * Prerequisites
       * Setup
* Installation on Windows (32bit, 64bit)
       * Prerequisites
       * Setup

**Tests on the library** : I suggest to use a python test framework like [unittest](https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html) to test the python library. It supports test automation and aggregation of the tests into collection.

**Documentation of the library** : Documenting Class definitions, methods definitions and links to the given source codes. 


Ability work on other knitting machines such as Knitic, Passap and OpenKnit
