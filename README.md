# KnitLib
**Library to support knitting machines** 

Projects like Ayab and Knitic access knitting machines. The AYAB has already created a plugin system for knitting machines and implemented talking to Brother KH 910/930 models. The software is based on Python and QT. The primary task is to develop a library based on this solution to add support for more machines.
